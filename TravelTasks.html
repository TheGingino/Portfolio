                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>This project was from a GameJam where we had to make a game in 2 days with the theme Travel.</p>

                        <h2>The idea around TravelTasks</h2>
                        <p>The idea of the game is that you have to do multiple tasks before you can go on your holiday. 
                            You have 3 lives, and if you fail your task, you’ll lose one (1) life. If you lose all lives, it’s game over. If you finish 15 amount, you win the game.</p>

                <h3>Team</h3>
                <p>The team consisted of 4 developers and 2 artists. This was an international GameJam so our Game Artists came from Sweden.</p>
                <h3>My contribution</h3>
                <p>The part that I worked on during this GameJam is the third minigame and the Start screen.</p>
                <h2>MiniGame3</h2>
                <img src="gifs/TravelTaskMinigame.gif" alt="Minigame 3 gameplay">
                <p>This is small a small gif of the gameplay where it says in the UI that you need to press the spacebutton to move. It was made in Unity and uses C# as its coding language. </p>
                <h3>This image is of how the Start screen of the game looks like</h3>

                <p>It was fun working on this and this is where you can find the project</p>
