                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>The goal of this project was to make a Tower Defense game. you needed 3 of 8 criteria of a list and add them to your game. like multiple kinds of enemies or an upgrade system.</p>
                <p>The Time I had for this project was 8 weeks.</p>

                    <div class="TowerDefense-text">
                        <h2>The idea around TD Inc.</h2>
                        <p>For this I looked at already existing Tower Defense games and searched for features I wanted to add myself.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Team</h3>
                <p>The team consisted of just me. It was a solo projected to start the year.</p>
                <h3>My contribution</h3>
                <p>I worked on most features of this game. Like the currency system and upgrading your towers.</p>
                <h2>Stopwatch</h2>
                <img src="gifs/Stopwatch.gif" alt="Minigame 3 gameplay">
                <p>A Small gif of the stopwatch running while playing the game</p>
                <h3>These are 2 screenshots of how the code looks of the stopwatch</h3>
                <ul class="code column">
                    <li class="code">
                        <img src="IMG/stopwatch code.png" alt=""></a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="code">
                        <img src="IMG/stopwatchcode2.png" alt=""></a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Enemy Spawning</h2>
                <h3>Small snippits of the enemy moving and the waypoint updating</h3>
                <ul class="code column">
                    <li class="code">
                        <img src="IMG/Path.png" alt=""></a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="code">
                        <img src="IMG/Updating.png" alt=""></a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is where you can see the enemy moving and see the Waypoint number update and that means its moved past a certain waypoint. The max amount of waypoints is 16 which goes from beginning to the end. It allows the enemy to move on the path i have laid down for them.</p>
                <ul class="code column">
                    <li class="code">

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Planning</h3>
                <p>A trello board was used to make it clear for myself what I had to do and what was already done.</p>
