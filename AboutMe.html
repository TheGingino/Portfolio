                Good afternoon, I am Gino Schaap and am 18 years old. I live in the city of Amsterdam. I’m a 
                Software Developer and have worked on both sides from 
                web to game development but I specialize in Game 
                Development. I go as a Unity Game Developer and my 
                current focus is 3D games.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason for me even starting to be interested in this 
                field was because of some friends I made while joining a 
                Discord server where I began talking to them. They 
                always spoke about products and applications that they 
                made. One of them made a discord bot for the server 
                and I took an interest. I talked to them in a group chat 
                about it and it only made me want to do it more.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far I’ve learned Python, C#, Html, CSS and some JavaScript and was able to make a site 
                and games. I made a Platformer and an endless runner. The project I enjoyed the most so far 
                is the Endless runner because I was working alone and was able to project my own creative 
                mindset onto it. From references to other games and small details. A Project I’d like to work 
                on is a Horror styled game like Resident Evil.
              </p>

                As a child I started playing games with my siblings like Mortal Kombat, Mario Kart or another 
                multiplayer game. I then got around to Pokémon because of the show but my childhood 
                My favorite game currently and has been for the last 8 years is Pokémon White 2. The story felt different than most Pokémon 
                games as it took a darker tone
              </P>
